### Welcome to this tool that I do not know give a name to it. ###
---------------------------

**Requirements:**


- Have AutoIT installed: [Here](Https://www.autoitscript.com/cgi-bin/getfile.pl?autoit3/autoit-v3-setup.exe "Click Here")
- A Telegram account: [Here](Https://telegram.org/ "Click Here")

*Steps:*

> I'm considering that you know how to create a simple bot on the Telegram with BotFather. So let's continue!

Put the bot files in the folder, `\core\data\logs`, Then open the config.ini and fill in the Token and ID.

> Your Token you can get through the BotFather.
> Your ID is more complicated... I'll do a tutorial for this, in the next hours.

Go to `\core\_functions\_core\_Log.au3` and you can just add this code: `btnClearClick()` at the end of the **setLog()** function.

> Kev helped in this part, thanks.

Save and close the file.

**From now on, you will no longer open MslBot through the normal shortcut. You will only open msl-bot.au3**

With the msl-bot.au3 running, open the "other msl bot" and *See the magic happens*..


I accept suggestions.
Thanks to Kev for creating the bot.
I accept a role position in the Discord
